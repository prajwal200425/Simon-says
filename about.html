                <b>Sequence Generation:</b> <br>

The game generates a random sequence of colors. This sequence is usually shown with corresponding lights.
The sequence starts short and gets longer with each correct round.<br>
Watching the Sequence:<br>

Observe the sequence displayed by the game. The colors will flash or play in the order you need to remember.<br>
<b>Repeating the Sequence:</b><br>

After the sequence is shown, you must repeat it in the exact order.
Click or touch the buttons in the sequence that was shown.<br>
<b>Incorrect Sequence:</b><br>

If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you have to start over. You can reset and try again.
Listen or watch for any errors in your sequence.<br>
<b>Advancing Levels:</b><br>

Each correct sequence increases the difficulty by adding more steps to the sequence.
Continue to replicate the sequence correctly to advance through levels.
